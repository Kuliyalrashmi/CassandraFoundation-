# DS201: Foundations of Apache Cassandra™ by DATASTAX
 - In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Apache Cassandra™, its distributed architecture, and how data is stored. You will master Cassandra's internal architecture by studying the read path, write path, and compaction. Topics such as consistency, replication, anti-entropy operations, and gossip ensure you develop the skills necessary to build disruptive cloud applications. Hands-on exercises are available using the KillrVideo application as the reference data model.
